A minimum sensitivity of 200ppm of combustible gas is achieved.

How to use it? 

Components Required -> 

	The following items can be procured online or from robotics shop easily...

	Electronic Components:-

	1. Arduino Microcontroller
	2. GSM GPRS Sim900A Module(Please first make sure your area supports GSM connection!)
	3. MQ-6 LPG Sensor Module
	4. MQ-2 Air Quality Sensor Module
	5. Piezo Buzzer
	6. Power adapter(that matches your GSM
	module power specifications, will
	also be used to power arduino)
	7. Some wire jumpers
	8. Two 10,000 Ohm resistance(not required if you get Sensors fixed with breakout board. )

	Non- Electric Components:-
	
	1. PVC box/casing

	Tools and Misc:-
